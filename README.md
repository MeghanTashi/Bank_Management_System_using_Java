# Bank Management System Using Java

Using Java, I created a Java-based Bank Management System. It works as a
console application no GUI is involved. There are several basic functions
in this project, such as createAccount(), displayAccount(), withdraw(),
deposit(), etc.

Yes, this project can be advanced and taken to another level, even
though it's a basic project for beginners.
